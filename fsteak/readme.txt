###Thank you for using fsteak, the premiere I/O library for steak-based files.

In order to make the library easy to learn, it has been constructed to be very similar
to the ANSI C file I/O functions.

Please look at fsteak.h for a list of the available functions. Their equivalent C file I/O
functions are documented.

Special thanks to Chie Satonaka, without whom this library would never have been made.
